# Corp Comment App

## Web application made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript that allows a user to enter comments publicly regarding their experience with certain companies. 

- The application makes API calls to an external server to get the previous posts and to store the new post the User makes.

- There is also some filtering logic that allows User to select a particular company and only see that company's posts.
